Ask people which hand is their dominant hand - choose only right handed people.

Ask people to fill in a questionnaire where they self-evaluate their experience with using gestures, where gestures are defined as anything else apart from touching, dragging or long press (because these are mouse equivalents of click, click and drag and right click). If more than 20 after dominant hand question, drop subjects depending on which way the average experience is going.

Other information that would be useful to collect from the participants:
- How much time they use touchscreen vs mouse vs touchpad
- Whether they have any experience with AR/MR/VR headsets
- How quickly they normally learn to use new technology

-------------------- ELICITATION -------------------------
Use one camera filming from in front (web camera). Ask people to all gestures once while looking at the camera and the second time while looking to the right side (so that the thumb is visible).

All the gestures have to be done with one hand ([33]) and ask participants to think out loud. Also, tell them to consider that the gesture would be used many times during the day and being able to do these gestures quickly is important.

Presentation of the gestures:
- UNDO(anuluoti): You have done something that you did not want to do. What gesture would you do to undo the action?
- REDO(is naujo): You have undone the previous action, but you changed your mind and you want to redo the same action again. What gesture would you use?
- COPY: There is a sentence selected on the screen in front of you. What gesture would you do to copy that text?
- PASTE: You have placed the cursor in a place in the text on the screen in front of you where you need to insert the copied text. What gesture would you do to insert that text in there.
- DELETE: You have some text selected on the screen. What gesture would you do to delete that text?
- SELECTION CONFIRMATION: Text selection is done using two fingers. You start selecting the text by touching the screen. Then you drag the fingers on the screen to the end point. How would you confirm that you have reached the end point of selection without lifting the fingers off the screen?

Also, check whether the users properly bend and extend the fingers if they're shown images on how to hold the hand when touching the plane with 1 and 2 fingers. That will determine whether the extended finger detection is a good way of implementing the click and selection.

Participant valuation of the gesture:
- How difficult was it to think of a gesture for this task?
- How good do you think this gesture is for this task?
- How difficult is it to perform the gesture?
- How easy do you think it would be to remember this gesture?

When participants do a gesture, ask follow up questions as well to understand what are the important characteristics (number of fingers, speed of movement, etc.).

Data collection about the gesture:
- Time it took to think of a gesture
- Time it took to do the gesture
Estimate both from the recording.

After all the gestures are suggested - ask to repeat the gestures to see if they remember them and if they want to change any of them. If there are any conflict among the gestures they proposed (if they seem too similar), ask them to think of new gestures.

-------------------- EVALUATION -------------------------

Group gestures for each referent into identical groups and calculate the group agreement rate as well as the average agreement rate using the AGATe Tool. The referent is assigned a gesture that has the biggest group (max_score(g_scores), where g_score is number of times that gesture is used for that referent). If few gestures have same gesture for bigger groups, the one referent with the larger group will win the gesture.
