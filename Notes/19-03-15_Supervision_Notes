Fix issues and backtrack to record the new gestures based on both fixes.
Discuss in the report how the other labeling methods didn't really work.

For multithreading, main issue is that the server speed doesn't match up with the client speed.
So choose a frame step based on the timing of the predictions.
And the frame steps don't have to match, the time between frames has to.
(E.g. recorded at 60fps and can do 6 predictions/second, so do frame step of 10 for training
Real time have fps of 40, then frame step would be 40/6 ~= 7)
Worth doing it with a queue (what I had before) or maybe there is a way to check the socket without blocking.
Unity blocks and doesn't print debugging because the instructions are not done in a row.

Copy of the directory and then delete the code.

And then last week to polish it up.

If questions about structure of the report, email.
Presentation is a week after the deadline - last year Tuesday.
And right after the report, will have presentation practice (same week - Friday).

Cap false positive rate and maximize true positives.
Use median false positive and possibly max false positive.
Max false positive rate is a requirement.
