do every single letter as gameobject

Given a coordinate in rectangle, find the letter.

Make it first (research), optimise later.

If the model changes, give me a new view.

start from the basic simple functions. Build a framework

Plan it out first - what is the model, what is the view.


Model-View-Controller

Model:
Array of strings (array of arrays)
Row index of primary array
Character index relative to secondary array (a string is an array)

View:
1. Render the model
2. Input support:
2a. Given a point, give me the row and character index
2b. Given a row and character index, give me the rendered coordinates

Controller:
Let's not worry about that
