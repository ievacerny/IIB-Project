1. Build basic text interaction app in Unity (a test bed)

  The app should support 'select', 'copy', 'paste', 'delete', 'cancel' actions. Use monospace font to make geometrical calculations easier. Make a plane that look like a text only webpage. Colliders on the words might help with selection.

  Possibly add a control panel with buttons for different tools that can be brought up by "looking" down (bringing the cursor down).

2. Write mock code or add keyboard controls to test the implemented actions separately from the gestures.

3. Get Leap Motion working with unity

4. Implement tracking on index finger

5. Implement action gestures using one finger

6. Implement full hand gesture based interactions

7. Possibly add multiple planes and move text between them using full hand gestures


All of this is parameter based interaction (e.g. text location, which plane).

As the project continues, setup product requirements. Don't count on testing with multiple people (might not be time for that)
