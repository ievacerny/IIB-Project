Option 1 (copy/paste)

1. Modify/create a text editor app to have copy-paste functionality within the app using onscreen buttons
2. Implement cross app functionality with buttons + keyboard (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V does work with bluetooth keyboard)
3. Think of new gestures for copy-paste; or think of a combination of existing gestures
4. Implement custom gestures

Problems:
- Implementing custom gestures for all apps is likely to be impossible
- Having gestures that work on one app only breaks the uniformity of the Hololens experience (not recommended by Microsoft people)

Advantages:
- Custom gesture implementation would be the most interesting (and challenging) part - involves machine learning


Option 2 (copy/paste)

1. Create custom keyboard with copy-paste buttons to work on test app
2. Think of new gestures for copy-paste; or think of a combination of existing gestures
3. Implement custom gestures to work with the custom keyboard
4. Make the keyboard integrable with other Hololens apps

Problems:
- Not clear how custom keyboard would integrate with other Hololens apps (if it would at all)

Advantages:
- Has custom gestures
- Wouldn't break the uniformity of the experience


Option 3 (text placement anywhere in the world)

1. Create/modify text editor app (one exists already)
2. Implement 3D coexistence of text anywhere in the world

Problems:
- It seems that only one 3D app can run at a time
(https://forums.hololens.com/discussion/1913/understanding-coexistence-of-apps-and-their-holograms-unity)
- An app with text placement anywhere exists already, therefore, all progress would depend on coexistence

Advantages:
- Closer to project current project description


Option 4 (gesture typing)

1. Create custom keyboard
2. Implement basic gesture typing on the keyboard
3. Improve the typing with machine learning
3. Integrate keyboard with other Hololens apps

Problems:
- Same as with Option 2: not sure if keyboard can be integrated
- Might be too challenging
- Might not be more comfortable than current typing

Advantages:
- A lot of information about gesture typing with Android
- Involves machine learning, possibly some NLP
