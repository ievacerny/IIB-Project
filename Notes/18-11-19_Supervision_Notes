Parameterise the selections

Dominant hand making fine selection, non dominant hand doing borader selection (e.g. confirming action)

Slow movement - stick the selection. Fast movement on a different action in a different axis could terminate action.

Could be timeout as well if noise of movement is higher than timeout noise

Think of what are the governing parameters. Is there a tradeoff between duration and noise

- Effective performance - error below a certain level and improve the timeout
- for minimal learning, not parameterising, give it to users to tests

People can be efficient within short time.

Gesture recognition can also be low parameter - success or Not
