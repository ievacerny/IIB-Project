1. Should I change the selection from two fingers to using thumb and index to mark the height of the text and drag it like that? Then confirmation could be tapping of those two fingers together. People didn't seem to like the two finger selection, especially the confirmation.
Not change, but discussion could say about that this is an alternative.

2. What should I do when calculating agreement if one gesture involves 2 gestures (direction of the circle not important vs important)
Parameters

2.5. Should I first discard gestures that are definitely not going to be used or should I keep them in for agreement calculations?
Tradeoff between what people want and robustnesss.

Do short-list and then do the agreement.

3. How should I group the gestures together?
Tag gestures: planar - non planar, metaphoric, dynamic - static, parametric. Gestures that have the same tags (+- error boundary) would be the same gesture. Treat mirror as a parameter. Affinity diagram

Mention that a possible confound variable is language barrier.
In method section describe what I've done. In discussion mention these observations - how people would be over confident and couldn't remember (Donner-Kruger).

4. Do zeros influence the model? How to account for that when real data will be present with non zero values? Weights can't be too large

5. Is it fine to truncate the gestures to reduce the dimensionality?


Read the report for not a gesture - hardest problem

Train on unsegmented gestures as to how it is going to be used in real time.

Write final report in royal we and direct short sentences. No passive voice.
Intro say contribution. In conclusion mentions contribution revisit contribution. Summary, intro and conclusion should say everything there is to say in the report.
