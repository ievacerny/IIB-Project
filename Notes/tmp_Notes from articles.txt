Unity - TouchScreenKeyboard class for accepting keyboard input. The onscreen keyboard doesn't work on volumetric view, another 2D view has to be used.

Text in Unity needs scaling. Conversion from meters to points is needed

Currently editing works on the whole block of text entered in one field.

When moving there's some shaking of the text - might reduce accuracy of text selection.

Have special select tool on the text menu and use two hand expansion gesture to expand or shrink selection.

There is a selection tool, but no copy paste? People complaining about the Edge and have to connect external keyboards to do Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V
