- People do x in different directions
- One guy did C formation with two fingers only
- Reducing the variability in training set would probably reduce accuracy in real time - should I do it?

Do gesture selection with my own dataset only. Then force friends to do the final gestures exactly as they are.


- Some gestures are very long - should I downsample them?

Duration is not actually a good measurement. Remove it completely and focus more on easy of performance.


To select the weights for qualities, think of the weights in terms of proportions.
E.g. accuracy is 5 times more important than how easy it was to think of a gesture


t-sne - clustering algorithm instead of SVD
