User-defined gestures for surface compute - Wobbrock
Agreement analysis toolkit (AGATe) - get gesture data into correct format.
Using camera is also fine.

Document the procedure of elicitation

Do offline results first, only then think about integration.

Motivate the gestures. Where does this come from, why are they good.
What are they describing, determine which features are good and which are not
(look at the weights) in offline analysis.

Very important to motivate why the system is designed in a certain way.

Don't think about the keyboard - not very important. Get the important project stuff going.

fast diagrams (functional design) for editing. Think what the user needs to do, not the system

Verification cross reference matrix. Every requirement maps to a verification method.
Did it pass or not. Don't have to be able to test all of the requirements.
